I have intermediate proficiency in *HTML, CSS* & *Javascript*. The **Linked-In Learning** platform has been my gateway into web dev. I really enjoy the disciplines of mathematics and art.  
Outside of web dev, I like to train my body, drive for uber and socialize and, most of all, brew _artisanal_ coffee.

The **Linked-In Learning** platform has been my gateway into web development. I have completed the *Learning Path: Become A Front-End Web Developer*.

# Relevant course certificates of completion:
- Programming Foundations: Fundamentals
- HTML Essential Training
- CSS Essential Training 1, 2, & 3
- Javascript Essential Training
- User Experience for Web Design
- UX Foundations: Accessibility
- Responsive Layout



Outside of web development I really enjoy the disciplines of **mathematics** and **art**, in addition to **training** my body, **socializing** and **brewing** artisanal coffee.
